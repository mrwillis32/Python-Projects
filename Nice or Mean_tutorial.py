#
# Purpose:      The Tech Academy - Python Coourse, Creating our first program together.
#               Demonstrating how to pass variables from function to function
#               While producing a functional game.
#
#               Remember, function_name (variable) _means that we pass in the variable.
#               return variable _means that we are returning the variable to
#               back to the calling function.
